Driver: You wouldn't buy something from an unknown person because the biggest problem there is the trust of the individuals
But you wouldn't be very hesitant to get something from your friend's friend or some one from your office even if you don't know them 
Also I would believe someone from my friend's company, So I came across this idea of having a trusted network of individuals who can transact among each other
The Network : 
People will be added to the network only on an invite basis and we will have a rating for each person in the network, Your rating increases when you transact on the network more and decreases due to a fraudulent activity from you or someone that has been invited to the network by you

Fail cases :
Handling a bad actor : 
Rating decrease for the bad actor and the person(s) inviting him with weight of the rating change decreasing as you go up the tree
